## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Prayer Campaign** | An organized prayer initiative with a defined time period, geographic focus, and prayer goals. Campaigns track subscriptions and measure coverage progress. |
| **Prayer Fuel** | Scheduled prayer prompts and focus content assigned to specific days of a campaign. Admins create Prayer Fuel entries that appear on the corresponding campaign day to guide subscribers in what to pray for. Can be scheduled daily, weekly, or monthly. |
| **Prayer Timer** | An interactive visual countdown clock (shortcode) that helps subscribers time their prayer sessions. Displays 5 rotating segments and counts down the selected duration. |
| **Prayer Commitments** | Also called "Prayer Times." The specific time slots a subscriber has signed up to pray. A single subscription can have multiple prayer commitments. |
| **24/7 Coverage** | A campaign goal type where the objective is to have at least one person praying during every hour of every day throughout the campaign. Tracked as a coverage percentage. |
| **Time Slot** | A specific time period (e.g., 15 minutes starting at 3:00 PM) that a subscriber selects for their prayer commitment. |
| **Coverage Percentage** | The metric showing what percentage of each day's hours are covered by prayer commitments. 100% means someone is praying during every time slot. |

## Extend vs Renew (Important Distinction)

| Term | Definition |

| **Auto extend prayer times** | An account setting that automatically extends prayer commitments without requiring user action. When enabled, the system adds new time slots before the current ones expire. |
| **Stop Praying** | Canceling future prayer time commitments. Past completed prayer times remain in the system for statistics. |

## Translation Notes

1. **Extend vs Renew**: These have distinct meanings. "Extend" adds more time slots to an existing commitment. "Renew" is recommitting to an expiring subscription. Do not use interchangeably.

2. **Prayer Fuel**: This is a specific feature name, not generic content. It refers to the scheduled daily prayer prompts. Consider keeping it as a proper noun or finding an equivalent that conveys "prayer guidance/prompts for each day."

3. **Placeholders**: `%s`, `%1$s`, `%2$s`, etc. are replaced with dynamic content. Preserve their position relative to surrounding text but translate everything else.

4. **Context markers (`msgctxt`)**: Some strings include usage examples like "August 18, 2021 from 03:15 am to 03:30 am for Tokyo, Japan" to show how placeholders are filled.

5. **Religious terms**: "Prayer Warriors" and "Intercessors" have specific Christian connotations. Consider cultural appropriateness and whether equivalent terms exist in the target language.

6. **Time formats**: Some cultures use 24-hour time vs 12-hour (AM/PM). The plugin handles this programmatically, but be aware when translating time-related strings.

7. **Ramadan content**: The Ramadan porch includes educational content about Islamic practices. Translate accurately while maintaining respectful tone.
