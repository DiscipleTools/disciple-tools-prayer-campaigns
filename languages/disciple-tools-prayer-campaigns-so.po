"Ramadan is one of the five requirements (or pillars) of Islam. During each "
"of its 30 days, Muslims are obligated to fast from dawn until sunset. During "
"this time they are supposed to abstain from food, drinking liquids, smoking, "
"and sexual relations.\n"
"\n"
"Women typically spend the afternoons preparing a big meal. At sunset, "
"families often gather to break the fast. Traditionally the families break "
"the fast with a drink of water, then three dried date fruits, and a multi-"
"course meal. After watching the new Ramadan TV series, men (and some women) "
"go out to coffee shops where they drink coffee, and smoke with friends until "
"late into the night.\n"
"\n"
"Though many have stopped fasting in recent years, and are turned off by the "
"hypocrisy, increased crime rates, and rudeness that is pervasive through the "
"month, others have become more serious about religion during this time. Many "
"attend the evening prayer services and do the other ritual prayers. Some "
"even read the entire Quran (about a tenth the length of the Bible). This "
"sincere seeking makes it a strategic time for us to pray for them."
