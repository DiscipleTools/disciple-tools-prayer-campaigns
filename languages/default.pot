"Ramadan is one of the five requirements (or pillars) of Islam. During each "
"of its 30 days, Muslims are obligated to fast from dawn until sunset. "
"During this time they are supposed to abstain from food, drinking liquids, "
"smoking, and sexual relations.\n"
"\n"
"     Women typically spend the afternoons preparing a big meal. At sunset, "
"families often gather to break the fast. Traditionally the families break "
"the fast with a drink of water, then three dried date fruits, and a multi-"
"course meal. After watching the new Ramadan TV series, men (and some "
"women) go out to coffee shops where they drink coffee, and smoke with "
"friends until late into the night.\n"
"\n"
"     Though many have stopped fasting in recent years, and are turned off "
"by the hypocrisy, increased crime rates, and rudeness that is pervasive "
"through the month, others have become more serious about religion during "
"this time. Many attend the evening prayer services and do the other ritual "
"prayers. Some even read the entire Quran (about a tenth the length of the "
"Bible). This sincere seeking makes it a strategic time for us to pray for "
"them."
