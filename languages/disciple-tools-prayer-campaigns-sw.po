"Ramadan is one of the five requirements (or pillars) of Islam. During each "
"of its 30 days, Muslims are obligated to fast from dawn until sunset. During "
"this time they are supposed to abstain from food, drinking liquids, smoking, "
"and sexual relations.\n"
"\n"
"Women typically spend the afternoons preparing a big meal. At sunset, "
"families often gather to break the fast. Traditionally the families break "
"the fast with a drink of water, then three dried date fruits, and a multi-"
"course meal. After watching the new Ramadan TV series, men (and some women) "
"go out to coffee shops where they drink coffee, and smoke with friends until "
"late into the night.\n"
"\n"
"Though many have stopped fasting in recent years, and are turned off by the "
"hypocrisy, increased crime rates, and rudeness that is pervasive through the "
"month, others have become more serious about religion during this time. Many "
"attend the evening prayer services and do the other ritual prayers. Some "
"even read the entire Quran (about a tenth the length of the Bible). This "
"sincere seeking makes it a strategic time for us to pray for them."
msgstr ""
"Ramadhani ni mojawapo ya mahitaji (au nguzo) tano za Uislamu. Katika kila "
"siku zake 30, Waislamu wanalazimika kufunga kuanzia alfajiri hadi kuzama kwa "
"jua. Wakati huu wanatakiwa kujiepusha na chakula, kunywa vinywaji, kuvuta "
"sigara, na mahusiano ya ngono.\n"
"\n"
"     Wanawake kwa kawaida hutumia mchana kuandaa chakula kikubwa. Jua "
"linapotua, familia mara nyingi hukusanyika ili kufungua mfungo. Kwa kawaida "
"familia hufungua saumu kwa kunywa maji, kisha matunda matatu yaliyokaushwa "
"ya tende, na mlo wa kozi nyingi. Baada ya kutazama kipindi kipya cha Ramadan "
"TV, wanaume (na baadhi ya wanawake) huenda kwenye maduka ya kahawa ambako "
"wanakunywa kahawa, na kuvuta sigara na marafiki hadi usiku sana.\n"
"\n"
"     Ingawa wengi wameacha kufunga katika miaka ya hivi majuzi, na wamezimwa "
"na unafiki, viwango vya uhalifu vilivyoongezeka, na ukosefu wa adabu ambao "
"umeenea kwa mwezi mzima, wengine wamekuwa wakizingatia dini zaidi wakati "
"huu. Wengi huhudhuria ibada za jioni na kufanya maombi mengine ya "
"kitamaduni. Wengine hata walisoma Kurani nzima (karibu sehemu ya kumi ya "
"urefu wa Biblia). Kutafuta huku kwa dhati kunafanya kuwa wakati wa kimkakati "
"kwetu kuwaombea."
