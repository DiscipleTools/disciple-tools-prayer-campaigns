# Disciple.Tools - Prayer Campaigns

Add prayer campaigns to your strategy inside Disciple.Tools. This module adds the ability to
mobilize saturation prayer for specific locations. It creates embeddable mobilization forms
for users to sign up, and direct links for them to manage their subscription, with a username and
password.

## Purpose

At the root of all movements you find extra-ordinary prayer. Adding this module to your Disciple.Tools system, allows
you to publish a prayer subscriptions form with the supporting management tools for subscribers through email magic links.
