# Disciple Tools - Subscription

Add a prayer subscription module to Disciple.Tools that allows for non-users to subscribe to pray for specific locations
at specific times, supporting both time and geographic prayer saturation for your project.

## Purpose

At the root of all movements you find extra-ordinary prayer. Adding this module to your disciple tools system, allows
you to publish a prayer subscription form with the supporting management tools for subscribers through email magic links.

## Usage

#### Will Do

- Adds a prayer-warrior post type to the system.
- Adds a magic registration form to the system to be published on a prayer mobilization website.
- Adds management interactions for subscribing and unsubscribing of prayer-warriors.

#### Will Not Do

- Mobilize prayer-warriors for you.
- Pray for you

## Requirements
